HEALTHCARE ANALYSIS - PATIENT WAIT LIST

DASHBOARD ON POWERBI

I'm excited to share my recent project where I used PowerBI to analysis and visualize data.
I have chosen practice dataset of HEALTHCARE DATA for analysis and visualization.

First I Cleaning the data then Transform. This project allow me to dive deep into PowerBI tools and formulas to analyze healthcare data.
In this project there are various columns like Archive_Date, Case_Type, Speciality_Name and even more.
In Case_Type there are three main options these are Inpatient, Outpatient, Day case.
I used many tools to analyze overall data using powerbi. 
I mentioned Latest Month Wait List and previous year Latest Month Wait List in this project.
I used slicer tool for Speciality_Name like "Anaesthetics" , "Breast Surgery" , "Cardiology" ,"Cardio_Thoracic Surgery" , "Clinical Immunology" and "Dental Surgery" .
I added Average and Median buttons using calculation Method. 


I performed many calculations : Sum of total by Archive_date and Case_Type for = Case_Type, Day Case, Inpatient
                                Sum of total by Archive_date and Case_Type for = Outpatient
                                Avg/Med Wait List by Case_Type
                                Avg_Profile Wait List by Time_Bands and Age_Profile
